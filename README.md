# Glowshot - Turn Boring Images Into Professional Ones

## Problem

Your screenshots look like crap. Your product images are boring. You need Photoshop or Figma just to add a decent background, and even then it takes forever. You don't have time for that, and you definitely don't want to pay $50/month for software you'll use once a week.

## Solution

Upload your image. Pick a background. Crop it. Download it. Done. Takes 30 seconds. Free. No account. No subscription. Works in your browser.
